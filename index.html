<section>
  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>
The Bitcoin Reference DID method (did:btcr) supports DIDs on the public Bitcoin blockchain. The Bitcoin Reference method has minimal design goals: a DID trust anchor based on the Bitcoin blockchain, updates publicly visible and auditable via Bitcoin transactions, and optionally, additional DID Document information referenced in the transaction OP_RETURN data field. No other Personal Identifiable Information (PII) would be placed on the immutable blockchain.
  </p>
  <p>
A secondary intent of the BTCR method is to serve as a very conservative, very secure example and some best practices for creating a DID method. The use cases for BTCR are focused on anonymous and pseudo-anonymous identities, web-of-trust style webs of identity, and absolute mimimal personal information disclosure. Other DID methods will likely need to loosen these standards.
  </p>
  <p>
Some aspects of the BTCR method will not be practical if inappropriately scaled — for instance, there is a transaction cost to update keys and DDO object, potential UTXO inflation (i.e. one additional unspent output for every BTCR-based identity), and even if segwit isn't used it could cause blockchain bloat. However, identities using the BTCR method can be a strong as Bitcoin itself -- currently securing billions of dollars of digital value.

  <h1>Basic Concepts</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>BTCR DID Format</h2>

    <p>
BTCR DIDs have the following format:
    </p>

    <pre class="nohighlight">
      btcr-did        = "did:btcr:" btcr-identifier
                       [ ";" did-service ] [ "/" did-path ]
                       [ "?" did-query ] [ "#" did-fragment ]
      btcr-identifier = txref-ext encoded transaction
    </pre>


<p class="issue"
      title="Need to finalize encoding of transaction">
BTCR uses TX references that deviate from Bech32 Encoded Transaction Position References. <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/didm-btcr/issues/1">didm-btcr issue 1</a>

Once the above issue is decided, btcr-identifier format should be defined similar to 
<a href="https://github.com/veleslavs/bips/blob/c83837536d6629f754ce5a88bbe245e0a615e76e/bip-XXXX-Bech32_Encoded_Transaction_Position_References.mediawiki">Bech32 Encoded Transaction Position References</a>
    </p>

    <p>
BTCR DID identifiers are a TXREF-EXT encoding of the DID creation/update transaction.

This encoding is based on <a href="https://github.com/veleslavs/bips/blob/c83837536d6629f754ce5a88bbe245e0a615e76e/bip-XXXX-Bech32_Encoded_Transaction_Position_References.mediawiki">Bech32 Encoded Transaction Position References</a>, but with the following modifications:

<ol>
  <li>Remove network prefixes (e.g. txtest1)</li>
  <li>Future: support for specifying tx output</li>
  <li>Future: support lightning ids</li>
</ol>

  <section>
    <h2>Creating a DID</h2>

    <p>
A BTCR DID is created by creating a Bitcoin transaction with an optional OP_RETURN data field referring to additional DID document material, as described in this section.
    </p>

    <p>
Abbreviations:
<ul>
  <li> Bi = bitcoin address i </li>
  <li> Pi = public key i </li>
  <li> Si = signing key i (or private key i) </li>
</ul>
    </p>

    <p>
Creating the initial BTCR DID:
<ol>
  <li> Create key set (B0/P0/S0) </li>
  <li> Create key set (B1/P1/S1) </li>
  <li> Create Bitcoin transaction: 
    <ul>
      <li> Output: Change address B1 </li>
      <li> Optional output: OP_RETURN <link to DDO continuation> </li>
      <li> Signing key is S0, which reveals public key P0 in the transaction </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Issue TX0 and wait for confirmation. <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/didm-btcr/issues/7">didm-btcr issue 7</a></li>
  <li> Get Extended TX Ref encoding of the confirmed transaction TXREF(TX0) <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/didm-btcr/issues/1">didm-btcr issue 1</a></li>

</ol>
At this point we have a DID of the format did:btcr:TXREF(TX0). 
</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Reading a DID</h2>
    <p>

<ol>
  <li>Extract the transaction references from the BTCR DID (i.e. did:btcr:TXREF(TX0)) </li>
  <li>Look up transaction. Is the transaction output spent?
    <ul>
      <li> no: this is the latest version of the DID. From this we can construct the DID Description (described below)</li>
      <li> yes: keep following transaction chain until the latest with an unspent output is found</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  See <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-spring2018/pull/74"> BTCR resolver</a> for additional details. TODO: merge in
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Updating a DID</h2>
    <p>
An entity updates the BTCR DID Description by spending the current transaction output. The BTCR Transaction Structure diagram shows how that is done in this second transaction.

<ol>
  <li> Create new tx like above, but send to B2 </li>
  <li> Set the OP_RETURN to the new DID Description </li>
  <li> Sign tx with S1 (P1 is revealed) </li>
</ol>
    </p>

  <h1>Versioning</h1>
  <p>
Version of this Specification
[Define how this spec will be versioned. This SHOULD be by using the ReSpec template and standard ReSpec versioning mechanism.]]
Version of the JSON-LD Context
[Define how your JSON-LD context will be versioned. This MUST use the mechanism defined in the DID spec.]]
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>Security Considerations</h1>
  <p>

Requirements from Method Spec Template definition:
<pre>
At least the following forms of attack MUST be considered: eavesdropping, replay, message insertion, deletion, modification, impersonation, and man-in-the-middle.  

Potential denial of service attacks MUST be identified as well.  

If the protocol incorporates cryptographic protection mechanisms, it should be clearly indicated which portions of the data are protected and what the protections are (i.e., integrity only, confidentiality, and/or endpoint authentication, etc.). 

Some indication should also be given to what sorts of attacks the cryptographic protection is susceptible.  

Data which should be held secret (keying material, random seeds, etc.) should be clearly labeled. 

If the technology involves authentication, particularly user-host authentication, the security of the authentication method MUST be clearly specified.

Residual risks (such as the risks from compromise in a related protocol, incorrect implementation, or cipher) after threat mitigation has been deployed.

This section MUST provide integrity protection and update authentication for all operations required by Section 7 of this specification (DID Operations).
